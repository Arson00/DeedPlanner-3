This is set of utilities and common functionalities designed to be copied between projects for convenience.
It's designed by be modified according to needs, but in a way which wouldn't make it project-specific.
Thought here is to be immediately usable when put in the project, with as little extra external code to support it as possible.

Many of utilities and functionalities available here assume presence and heavy use of two frameworks:
- DOTween
- Zenject/Extenject
